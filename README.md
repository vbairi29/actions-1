# Terminology
As you begin your cloud journey with Resource Manager, it's important to understand some terms and concepts:

# Resource: A manageable item that's available on the Azure platform. Virtual networks, virtual machines, storage accounts, web apps, and databases are examples of resources.

# Resource group: A logical container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group includes resources you want to manage as a group. Most Azure resources are contained in a resource group. You decide which resources belong in a resource group based on what makes the most sense for your solution.
